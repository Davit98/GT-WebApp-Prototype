# GT-WebApp-Prototype

This repo contains the code and the files for running the query sharing web application. The repository has two branches: *master* and *dlab_server_v*. *dlab_server_v* is the branch containing the version of the website that is deployed to our server: http://51.158.119.80/. *master*, on the other hand, is the branch containing the code used for generating the local applications (executable files). The local apps are available [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/d9xx4hhoxvgw45t/AACG5BXsMzooYKOiYAHCHYmKa?dl=0). 

For installing the necessary python libraries you can just run ```pip install -r requirements.txt```.

#### File descriptions
